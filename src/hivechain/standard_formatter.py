"""
Module: standard_formatter.py
Responsibility:
  - Format input that has been validated as conforming to expected patterns.
  - Convert the valid raw input into a structured prompt.
  - This module is designed to be modular so that you can later extend its behavior
    (e.g., adding punctuation, converting to a specific JSON structure, etc.)
