# fallback_formatter.py
"""
Module: fallback_formatter.py
Responsibility:
  - When raw input fails validation, this module uses a fallback formatting agent 
    (e.g., a cost-effective model like GPT-4o mini) to reformat and sanitize the input.
  - It inserts placeholder tags (e.g., {sanitized:object.type}) where necessary and 
    produces a structured prompt that the downstream API caller can handle.
  - In this stub, we simulate the fallback behavior. In a complete implementation, the
    function would call the formatting agent and process its output.
"""

def sanitize_input(raw_input: str) -> dict:
    """
    Processes raw input using a fallback mechanism to generate a structured prompt.
    
    Args:
        raw_input (str): The raw user input that failed validation.
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with the following keys:
            - "prompt": The sanitized and formatted prompt ready for the API caller.
            - "fallback": A boolean flag indicating that fallback formatting was applied.
            - "details": (Optional) Additional details on what was sanitized or any tags inserted.
    
    TODO:
        - Integrate an API call to a cost-effective model (e.g., GPT-4o mini) to perform the formatting.
        - Insert tags or annotations (e.g., {sanitized:object.type}) where parts of the input are unclear or redacted.
        - Handle potential errors from the formatting agent and provide informative messages.
