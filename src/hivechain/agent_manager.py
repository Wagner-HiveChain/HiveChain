# agent_manager.py
"""
Module: agent_manager.py
Description:
  Manages smart agents and multi-agent workflows.
  Defines a base Agent interface (e.g., Agent.generate(prompt, context)) and a stub implementation.
  Also provides an AgentManager to register agents and delegate tasks.
  
Key Tasks:
  - Define an Agent interface with an abstract method generate(prompt, context).
  - Provide a SimpleAgent as a stub implementation.
  - Implement an AgentManager to manage multiple agents and aggregate their responses.
  
Keywords: agents, multi-agent, coordination, plugin.

#Placeholder: Extend to support orchestration of multiple agents, task delegation strategies, and result aggregation.
