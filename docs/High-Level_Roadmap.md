# High-Level Roadmap

- **MVP Development (Current Stage):**  
  Our initial focus has been on building the core functionality of HiveChain. In this stage, we have developed a basic prototype that demonstrates how AI models can be connected to simple applications. The goal was to validate the concept with minimal features and gather early feedback. We have kept the scope lean to ensure the foundation is solid before expanding functionality.

- **Alpha Release and Feedback (Next Step):**  
  Once the MVP is stable, we plan to release an alpha version to a select group of early users and contributors. During this phase, the emphasis will be on testing HiveChain in real-world scenarios, identifying integration challenges, and collecting user feedback. We expect to refine the user experience, fix bugs, and add a few essential features based on the needs of our early adopters.

- **Beta Expansion (Upcoming):**  
  After incorporating feedback from the alpha phase, we aim to expand HiveChain’s capabilities for a beta release. This phase will likely include support for a broader range of AI models or providers, additional integration connectors (such as databases, APIs, or messaging systems), and improved scalability and security features. We anticipate that during the beta phase, HiveChain can be tested in more production-like environments, though it will still be an early-stage product used with appropriate caution.

- **Community Building and Partnerships:**  
  In parallel with the technical roadmap, we are actively building a community around HiveChain. This involves creating thorough documentation, establishing governance (including contribution guidelines and a Code of Conduct), and engaging with potential integration partners. We recognize that partnerships with AI service providers or early adopter businesses can greatly enhance HiveChain’s development. Given our resource constraints, we will progress deliberately, focusing on high-impact collaborations that validate our approach.

- **Full Release and Ongoing Improvement:**  
  Our ultimate goal is to reach a stable 1.0 release of HiveChain, signifying that the platform is robust enough for a wider range of applications. Leading up to this milestone, we will continuously improve the platform—optimizing performance, ensuring robust error handling, and fine-tuning integration workflows. After 1.0, the focus will shift to ongoing enhancements based on user needs and the evolving AI landscape. Potential future enhancements include more automated methods to align AI outputs with business objectives and tools to monitor AI performance in production. These ideas are part of our long-term vision, but we will introduce them carefully, keeping user feedback and reliability as top priorities.

*Note:* This high-level roadmap is subject to change. As an early-stage project, HiveChain will adapt to feedback and practical insights. Timelines are kept flexible to account for our limited team size and the complexity of integrating cutting-edge AI. Our priority is delivering a reliable and useful platform, even if that means adjusting milestones along the way.
