## **🔥 Draft: High-Level Roadmap**  

# **🚀 HiveChain Roadmap**  

This document outlines the **major milestones** for HiveChain’s development as we move from MVP to a fully functional AI integration framework.  

### **🌱 Phase 1: MVP Development (Current Stage)**
✅ **Core Library Development** – Implement foundational AI model orchestration, RAG integration, and agent-based retrieval.  
✅ **Multi-Model API Support** – Allow seamless switching between multiple AI providers.  
✅ **Basic Documentation** – Establish clear guides for contributors and early adopters.  
✅ **Initial Contributor Onboarding** – Open early access for developers interested in shaping HiveChain.

### **🚧 Phase 2: Refinement & Expansion**
🟡 **Advanced RAG & Memory Systems** – Improve retrieval augmentation for better long-term AI recall.  
🟡 **Modular Integration API** – Provide better customization for developers using different AI workflows.  
🟡 **Developer Tools & Sandbox Mode** – Enable local testing and easy debugging.  
🟡 **First Community-Led Contributions** – Engage early users to help shape the project’s direction.

### **🖥️ Phase 3: UI & Broader Adoption**
🔵 **User Interface Development** – Move from a library-based system to an intuitive UI.  
🔵 **One-Click AI Customization** – Enable easy, non-technical configuration of multi-AI setups.  
🔵 **Enterprise Integrations & Partnerships** – Expand HiveChain’s usability in business settings.  
🔵 **Initial Monetization Strategy** – Introduce premium tools while keeping the core free.
