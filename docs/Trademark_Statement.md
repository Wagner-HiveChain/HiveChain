# Trademark Statement

"HiveChain" is the trademark (and brand name) associated with our AI integration platform. We ask that our community and the public respect the proper use of this name to avoid confusion and protect the project’s identity and reputation.

**Allowed Uses:**  
You may use the name "HiveChain" to refer to the project, its open-source software, or the community in articles, tutorials, and discussions. For example, phrases like "built on HiveChain" or "using the HiveChain platform" are acceptable when accurately describing your integration or product in relation to our project.

**Prohibited Uses:**  
You may not use the "HiveChain" name or logo in a way that suggests official endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation where none exists. This includes not using "HiveChain" as part of your own product’s name, company name, or domain name if your project is unrelated to the HiveChain platform. Similarly, do not modify or incorporate our logo into your own project branding in a manner that could mislead others into thinking your project is officially connected to us.

We reserve the right to enforce our trademark rights to prevent misuse. These guidelines are not meant to discourage legitimate references to HiveChain, but rather to ensure that "HiveChain" clearly and consistently refers to our project.

If you have any questions about using the HiveChain name or logo, or if you wish to seek permission for a specific use, please contact the HiveChain team.
