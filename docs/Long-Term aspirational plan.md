# Developer Equity Incentive Plan (Draft)

*This document outlines our long-term vision for a developer equity incentive plan. Please note that this plan is a work in progress and is subject to further refinement, legal review, and potential changes as HiveChain evolves.*

## Overview

HiveChain is committed to building an innovative, transparent, and community-aligned organization. As part of our long-term vision, we plan to set aside a **5% equity pool** to reward early contributors—developers, designers, and other key collaborators—who help build and sustain our platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Convertible Notes with Future Token Conversion

- **Initial Instrument:**  
  Early contributions will be rewarded with convertible notes. These notes grant an equity stake in HiveChain and are designed to pay dividends based on the company’s performance.
  
- **Future Conversion to Tokenized Equity:**  
  At a later stage, once HiveChain has matured and our technical and legal frameworks are fully in place, these notes may be converted into tokenized coins.  
  *Disclaimer:* Conversion to tokens is not guaranteed; contributors may retain their notes if conversion is not feasible.

### 2. Dividend Payment System

- **Performance-Based Dividends:**  
  Dividends will be allocated based on the actual performance of the company. This means that dividends will be calculated using a transparent formula:
  - **Dividends = (Company Revenue - Expenses) × [Pre-Defined Dividend Allocation Percentage]**
  
- **Escrow and Withdrawal Mechanism:**  
  - Dividends will be held in a secure escrow account.
  - Contributors will receive a unique serial number and private key with their note.
  - An API and user-friendly GUI will allow contributors to check their dividend balance.
  - Withdrawals will only be enabled when the accumulated dividend amount exceeds a minimum threshold (to avoid frequent micro-withdrawals).

### 3. Long-Term Vision & Disclaimers

- **Aspirational, Not Immediate:**  
  This plan is designed as a long-term incentive mechanism. The details of the convertible notes, dividend formulas, and potential token conversion are subject to change as the project develops.
  
- **No Immediate Guarantee:**  
  While our goal is to implement this equity pool to reward early contributors, there is no guarantee that every element (e.g., token conversion) will be executed exactly as described. Changes may occur based on legal, technical, and business considerations.
  
- **Commitment to Transparency:**  
  In keeping with our open-book policy, all financial transactions, including dividend calculations and distributions, will be published publicly (to the extent legally permitted). This ensures that our process remains transparent and aligned with our core values.

## Conclusion

HiveChain’s Developer Equity Incentive Plan represents our commitment to rewarding genuine contributions and aligning the interests of our community with the success of the company. We believe that by building an organization where rewards are based on actual performance—and by maintaining transparency throughout—we can set a new standard for ethical and community-focused innovation.

*This document is a draft and will be updated over time. We welcome feedback from our community to help shape this initiative into a robust, fair, and sustainable incentive model.*
