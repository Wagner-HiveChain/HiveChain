# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to HiveChain! Your involvement helps shape the future of AI integration and makes HiveChain more robust and useful for everyone. This guide outlines how to get involved and the best practices to follow.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   Fork the HiveChain GitHub repository to your account to create a personal copy of the project.
2. **Create a Branch:**  
   Create a new branch in your fork for your contribution. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-XYZ-connector` or `bugfix/fix-integration-issue`) to indicate what you are working on.
3. **Make Changes:**  
   Develop your feature or bug fix in your branch. Follow the coding style and structure of the existing code. If you add a new integration module or significant feature, include documentation or comments to help others understand your work.
4. **Write Tests (If Applicable):**  
   If the project has automated tests, consider writing tests for your changes. This helps catch any issues early and ensures that your contribution does not break existing functionality.
5. **Commit Your Changes:**  
   Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages that briefly state what was changed and why (e.g., `Add support for XYZ API connector to improve data import functionality`).
6. **Push and Open a Pull Request:**  
   Push your branch to your GitHub fork and open a Pull Request (PR) to the main HiveChain repository. In the PR description, provide a concise summary of your changes, why they are needed, and any relevant context. If your PR addresses an open issue, reference that issue number (e.g., “Fixes #42”).
7. **Collaborate During Review:**  
   A maintainer will review your pull request and may request changes or ask clarifying questions. Please be open to this feedback. Update your PR by pushing additional commits to your branch. The PR will automatically reflect these updates.
8. **Sign the CLA:**  
   Before your contribution can be merged, you need to sign the Contributor License Agreement (if you haven’t already done so). This is usually a quick process (often via an online form or bot instruction) and is required to ensure that you agree to license your contribution under the project’s terms. See the **Contributor License Agreement** document for details.

## Code Style and Guidelines
- **Consistency:**  
  Keep your code style consistent with the project. For Python code, follow PEP 8 guidelines. We recommend using linters/formatters (such as `flake8` or `black`) to format your code automatically.
- **Documentation:**  
  Update documentation for any user-facing changes. This might mean editing the README, adding a section to the Getting Started guide, or commenting your code as needed.
- **Focused Commits/PRs:**  
  Try to make each pull request focused on one topic or fix. Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and merge. If you have multiple unrelated changes, split them into separate PRs.

## Communication
- **Opening Issues:**  
  If you have an idea or find a bug, feel free to open an issue on GitHub to discuss it before investing time in code changes. This can help gather input from maintainers or the community.
- **Community Channels:**  
  Join our community channels (such as Slack, Discord, or a mailing list, as listed on our site) to ask questions and engage with other contributors.
- **Respect and Professionalism:**  
  All interactions in the project are governed by our Code of Conduct. Be respectful and constructive in all communications.

## Acknowledgments
Every contribution is valuable—whether it is a major feature, a minor fix, or improvements to documentation. We thank everyone who helps improve HiveChain. By contributing, you become part of a community working together to build a powerful platform for AI integration.
