# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HiveChain project. This Contributor License Agreement outlines the terms under which contributions are made to HiveChain. The goal is to ensure that the project’s codebase remains clear in terms of intellectual property rights and that both contributors and maintainers are protected.

By making a contribution to this project, you agree to the following terms:

(a) **Original Work:**  
The contribution is your own original creation, and you have the legal right to license it to the project. If the contribution includes or is based on work from others, that work must be under an open-source license compatible with HiveChain, and you have the right to submit it under the same license that governs the HiveChain project.

(b) **License Grant:**  
You grant the maintainers of HiveChain a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense your contribution as part of the project. This means your contribution will be released under the same open-source license that governs the HiveChain project (currently Apache 2.0, unless otherwise specified), allowing it to be freely used in all future versions and distributions of HiveChain ([Building hived (Hive blockchain P2P node) - GitLab](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/blob/f82e0f1cfd1ecc46652859b0fb9f9fd3b3a9408c/doc/building.md#:~:text=CMake,used%20as%20the%20build%20executor)).

(c) **No Patent Liability:**  
If your contribution includes any patented technology, you agree to grant a patent license to the project and its users so that they can freely use, modify, and distribute your contribution without concern for patent claims. In other words, you promise not to bring patent infringement lawsuits against the project or its users for utilizing your contribution as part of HiveChain.

(d) **Contribution Record:**  
You understand that your contribution and identifying information (such as your name and contact information) may be recorded in the project’s history. This record is maintained indefinitely as part of the version control system to preserve the provenance of the code. The information will be redistributed as part of the project’s open development process, consistent with the project’s license.

(e) **No Obligation or Warranty:**  
You are not required to provide support for your contribution, nor is the project obligated to include your contribution. The contribution is provided “as is” without warranties, and the decision to include it in the project will be made by the maintainers based on the project’s needs and quality standards. Likewise, the project does not guarantee that it will use or continue to use your contribution.

By contributing, you certify that you have read and agree to this CLA. If you are contributing on behalf of an employer or another entity, you certify that you have the authority to accept these terms on their behalf.

*This Contributor License Agreement is adapted from standard open-source CLA templates (including the Developer Certificate of Origin model) to fit HiveChain’s needs. It is intended to protect both contributors and project maintainers. For reference, portions of this CLA text are inspired by widely used agreements in the open-source community. If you have questions about the CLA or require an exception (for example, contributing under a different license), please contact the project maintainers to discuss it.
