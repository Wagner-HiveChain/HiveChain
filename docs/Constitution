# The Constitution of Decentralized Business  
### Version 1.0 – A Framework for Ethical Capitalism

---

## Preamble

Freedom and ownership are the foundations of innovation.  
Throughout history, businesses have driven progress, created wealth, and shaped the modern world. Yet, as corporations expanded, power became increasingly centralized—shifting control away from those who create value and toward those who extract it.

This Constitution establishes a governance framework that refines capitalism by ensuring that **ownership aligns with contribution, transparency replaces secrecy, and long-term sustainability prevails over short-term exploitation.** It is not intended to replace capitalism but to enhance it by safeguarding individual opportunity, ethical responsibility, and fair participation in governance.

This document provides the core principles for decentralized business governance. Detailed operational policies—including contribution measurement, stake decay mechanics, ethics enforcement procedures, and public trading rules—shall be articulated in separate, updateable policy documents.

## Article 1: Ownership & Stake Structure

### Section 1.1 – Principle of Earned Ownership
Ownership shall be based on **active contribution rather than entitlement.** Stake in the enterprise must be **earned through demonstrable participation** or acquired via regulated public investment, ensuring that governance remains in the hands of those who drive the company’s success.

### Section 1.2 – Stakeholder Categories
There shall be two classes of stakeholders:
1. **Contributors:** Individuals actively engaged in the creation, development, or governance of the company.
2. **Public Shareholders:** Investors who acquire stake through a transparent, regulated public market once the company is publicly traded.

### Section 1.3 – Contributor Governance Control
- **Non-transferability:** Stake earned through contribution is non-transferable and shall not be subject to sale in public markets.
- **Mandatory Majority:** Contributors shall collectively retain no less than **51% of total governance control** at all times.
- **Dynamic Stake:** To ensure active participation, stake may be subject to gradual decay; however, a defined grace period and provisions for approved temporary inactivity (e.g., for health or family exigencies) shall protect long-term contributors.  
  *(Exact parameters and exceptions are specified in the [Stake Allocation Policy](stake-allocation-policy.md).)*

### Section 1.4 – Public Shareholder Limitations
- **Controlled Exposure:** Public investment is limited to a maximum of **49% of total stake,** ensuring that external funding does not compromise contributor control.
- **Voting Weight:** Public Shareholders receive voting rights proportionate to their stake, but mechanisms are in place to prevent any concentration of public holdings that could undermine the 51% contributor mandate.  
  *(Specific safeguards and consolidation limits are detailed in the [Public Trading Guidelines](public-trading-guidelines.md).)*

## Article 2: Governance & Decision-Making

### Section 2.1 – Weighted Voting System
- **Enhanced Contributor Influence:** Each unit of contributor-earned stake carries **1.5 times the voting weight** compared to public-held stake, which carries a weight of **1.0 per unit.**

### Section 2.2 – Protection of Contributor Majority
- **Minimum Control Rule:** At all times, contributors must retain at least **51% of total voting power.**
- **Supermajority for Critical Decisions:** Major governance actions require a **67% supermajority vote,** thereby safeguarding against abrupt or unrepresentative shifts in control.

### Section 2.3 – Transparency in Decision-Making
- **Public Record:** All governance decisions, including votes and supporting rationales, shall be recorded in a manner that is **publicly accessible and immutable.**
- **Active Participation:** Voting rights may be adjusted based on active participation, ensuring that only engaged stakeholders influence outcomes.

### Section 2.4 – Accountability for Ethics Violations
- **Fair Penalties:** Violations of established ethical standards shall result in **proportionate penalties,** which may include temporary suspension of governance privileges or partial reduction in stake.
- **Independent Review:** Any enforcement action shall be subject to review by an **independent ethics board** to prevent abuse or politically motivated purges.  
  *(Detailed procedures are provided in the [Ethics & Compliance Framework](ethics-compliance-framework.md).)*

## Article 3: Contribution, Stake Decay, & Merit-Based Governance

### Section 3.1 – Vetting and Allocation of Stake
- **Meritocratic Awarding:** New contributors shall undergo a vetting period before being allocated permanent stake, ensuring that only substantive contributions are rewarded.
- **Proportional Recognition:** Contributions—whether technical, strategic, legal, or operational—are recognized proportionately to their value.  
  *(Specific allocation metrics are governed by the [Stake Allocation Policy](stake-allocation-policy.md).)*

### Section 3.2 – Dynamic Stake Maintenance
- **Gradual Decay:** To discourage passive accumulation, stake shall decay gradually during periods of prolonged inactivity.
- **Grace Period and Exemptions:** A grace period is provided to accommodate temporary inactivity, and contributors may apply for exemptions in cases of justified absence.  
  *(Operational details are set forth in the [Stake Allocation Policy](stake-allocation-policy.md).)*

### Section 3.3 – Equitable Recognition of All Contributions
- **Holistic Valuation:** All forms of contribution are valued, ensuring that non-technical inputs such as business strategy and legal counsel receive equitable consideration.

## Article 4: Monetization & Public Investment

### Section 4.1 – Regulated Public Trading
- **Strict Ownership Cap:** Public investment shall not exceed **49% of total stake,** thereby preserving contributor majority control.
- **Preventing Consolidation:** Rules shall prohibit the concentration of public shareholdings that could lead to hostile takeovers or a shift in governance power.  
  *(Detailed safeguards are provided in the [Public Trading Guidelines](public-trading-guidelines.md).)*

### Section 4.2 – Revenue Distribution and Sustainability
- **Balanced Allocation:** Revenues shall be allocated among reinvestment for innovation, compensation and rewards for contributors, and profit-sharing with stakeholders.
- **Long-Term Focus:** Short-term profit incentives shall not override the commitment to long-term sustainability and ethical business practices.

---

## Article 5: Transparency & Ethical Safeguards

### Section 5.1 – Comprehensive Transparency
- **Open Records:** All financial transactions and governance decisions shall be documented and made publicly accessible in a tamper-proof format.
- **No Hidden Dealings:** The existence of hidden salaries, undisclosed deals, or off-the-books transactions is strictly prohibited.

### Section 5.2 – Anti-Corruption and Ethics Enforcement
- **Clear Standards:** Ethical standards are established to prevent corruption, undue influence, and conflict of interest.
- **Proportional Consequences:** Violations of ethics shall incur proportional penalties—ranging from temporary suspension of rights to partial stake reduction—subject to independent review to ensure fairness.  
  *(Enforcement details are delineated in the [Ethics & Compliance Framework](ethics-compliance-framework.md).)*

### Section 5.3 – Voting Integrity and Oversight
- **Auditability:** All votes are subject to full audit and oversight, ensuring that the voting process is free from manipulation.
- **Right of Appeal:** Stakeholders maintain the right to challenge decisions through a structured, transparent appeals process.  
  *(Procedural details are set out in the [Voting & Governance Rules](voting-governance-rules.md).)*

## Article 6: Evolution & Future-Proofing

### Section 6.1 – Constitutional Adaptability
- **Versioning:** This Constitution is subject to periodic review and shall be versioned like software, enabling controlled updates without compromising its core principles.
- **Supermajority Requirement:** Amendments to the Constitution require a **67% supermajority vote** to ensure stability and broad consensus.

### Section 6.2 – Separation of Core and Operational Policies
- **Core vs. Operational:** While this Constitution defines the foundational principles, detailed operational policies (e.g., for stake allocation, ethics enforcement, and public trading) are maintained separately and may be updated independently.
- **Open-Source Adoption:** This framework is open-source and may be adopted by other entities provided that any modifications respect the foundational principles herein and are transparently disclosed.

# Final Declaration

This Constitution is the blueprint for ethical capitalism—a system that empowers contributors, ensures transparent governance, and promotes long-term sustainable growth. It refines traditional capitalism by aligning ownership with merit, safeguarding against exploitation, and fostering accountability without resorting to punitive overreach.

It is not an attempt to regulate every operational detail but to establish enduring principles that guide decentralized business governance.

**Signed and Ratified by the Founding Stakeholders of The Constitution of Decentralized Business.**
