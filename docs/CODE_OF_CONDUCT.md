# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the HiveChain community, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to treating everyone with respect, professionalism, and patience, regardless of background or experience. Our community is built on collaboration and trust, and we will work together to foster an environment that is welcoming and inclusive.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing when mistakes occur, and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities & Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—such as issue trackers, discussion forums, chat channels, and project events—and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Representation includes acting as a maintainer, using an official project e-mail address or social media account, or participating as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the HiveChain project team (refer to the project’s repository or website for contact information). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter and any others involved in an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by the project’s leadership.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available on the Contributor Covenant website. For answers to common questions about this Code of Conduct, see the FAQ on the Contributor Covenant website or contact the HiveChain maintainers for assistance.
