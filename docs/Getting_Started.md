# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up HiveChain and run a simple example to understand how the platform works. As HiveChain is in an early MVP stage, the setup is straightforward but may require familiarity with basic development tools.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System:** HiveChain is cross-platform, but it is primarily tested on modern 64-bit Linux distributions. It should also run on macOS and Windows with minimal adjustments.
- **Python 3.x Environment:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Verify your Python version by running `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **Dependencies:** HiveChain uses several Python libraries for interfacing with AI models and other services. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. An internet connection is required to download these dependencies.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/HiveChain.git
   cd HiveChain
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Basic Configuration:**  
   If HiveChain requires any configuration (for example, API keys for external AI services or paths to model files), copy the provided sample config (e.g., `config.example.yml`) to a new file (e.g., `config.yml`) and update it with your settings.
5. **Run an Example:**  
   To verify that everything is set up correctly, run the sample script or demo included in the repository:
   ```bash
   python examples/hello_hivechain.py
   ```
   Check the console output for confirmation that HiveChain initialized properly and that you received an AI-generated response.
6. **Explore the Platform:**  
   Once the example runs successfully, start exploring HiveChain further. Review the `README.md` for an overview of features and usage. The `docs/` directory (if available) contains more detailed explanations of HiveChain’s architecture and how to create custom integration workflows. Keep in mind that, as an early MVP, some features are limited or in-progress. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to our documentation or seek help from the community.

## Next Steps
- **Join the Community:**  
  Connect with us via our discussion forum or chat channels (links are available on our repository or website). Share your experiences, ask questions, and learn from other HiveChain users and contributors.
- **Stay Updated:**  
  As HiveChain is actively evolving, we recommend watching (or “starring”) the GitHub repository to receive notifications about new updates, fixes, and features. Regularly pull the latest changes if you are tracking the main branch.
- **Contribute:**  
  If you’re interested in contributing to HiveChain’s development, read the **Contributing** guide. There are many ways to help—from coding new features or connectors to improving documentation and providing feedback on design decisions.
