# HiveChain FAQ  

### 🤔 What is HiveChain  
HiveChain is a multi-AI integration, RAG, and agent framework that simplifies custom AI orchestration. It brings meta-controls that are usually locked behind large AI companies’ backends to the front end, making AI models more accessible, customizable, and easy to integrate.  

With HiveChain, developers can  
- Seamlessly integrate multiple AI models and APIs into their workflows.  
- Leverage RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for better, context-aware AI responses.  
- Customize and extend AI behavior without being locked into a single ecosystem.  

---

### 💡 What Makes HiveChain Different  
Unlike traditional AI orchestration tools, HiveChain is  
- Integration-First – Designed to work with multiple AI models and APIs seamlessly.  
- Highly Customizable – Users have control over how AI systems interact, rather than being forced into black-box solutions.  
- Transparent & Developer-Friendly – We prioritize clear, modular systems that don’t lock users into proprietary AI ecosystems.  

---

### 🚀 What’s the Current Status  
HiveChain is currently in its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase. The early focus is on  
- Building the core Python framework for AI model orchestration.  
- Developing RAG & agent-based retrieval systems to improve AI memory and context awareness.  
- Refining API integrations to support plug-and-play multi-model usage.  

Developers and AI engineers interested in early access and contributions can check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](.CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 💻 How Can I Contribute  
We welcome contributions in multiple areas  
- Code & API Integrations – Help expand the supported AI models and improve retrieval logic.  
- Documentation – Making the framework easier to use for new developers.  
- Issue Reporting & Feature Requests – Identify gaps, suggest improvements, and discuss AI use cases.

### 📜 What License Does HiveChain Use  
HiveChain is open-source for individuals and non-commercial use.  
- Free for personal & non-commercial projects – Fork, modify, and build upon it.  
- Commercial license required for businesses – Companies that integrate HiveChain into proprietary products need a separate license.  

---

### 🔄 Future Licensing & Policy Changes  
HiveChain is still evolving, and while our goal is to keep core technology open and accessible, we reserve the right to adjust our licensing and policies as needed.  

What does this mean for users  
- If licensing terms change in the future, existing users will retain the rights they had under the version they originally adopted.  
- Any major policy shifts will be communicated transparently, with reasonable notice.  
- We believe in fairness and trust, and we will always aim to balance sustainability with openness.  

---

### 🛠 What Are the Long-Term Goals  
- Expand multi-AI integrations with a broad range of APIs and models.  
- Build an intuitive UI layer for seamless AI customization.  
- Provide enterprise-grade tools for AI workflow automation.
